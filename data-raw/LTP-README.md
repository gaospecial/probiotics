> Five international partners together with the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology (SAM) started â€œ**The All-Species Living Tree" Project (LTP)** to provide a valuable resource particularly for microbial taxonomists. The aim of the project is to reconstruct separate and curated 16S and 23S rRNA datasets and trees spanning **all sequenced type strains** of the hitherto classified species of *Archaea* and *Bacteria*.

> These datasets and trees are **regularly updated** by adding new species with validly published names appearing monthly in the **validation and/or notification lists of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM)**
